Bang

TODO:

ENUM your bang constants
Respond code very much duplicated in manual user interface
Use wait locks on response lists.
Damage notes
Played notes
Graveyard... dead players and their roles... maybe off the bottom and greyed out
Remove duplicate UI... play cards from your hand instead of a copy of your hand?
Always put you in the middle of the screen... easy to see distance + and -
Highlight targets (onmouseover onmouseout)
^ in game... cards with suits... should be removed
